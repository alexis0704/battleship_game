As the name implies, this is the code for a simple battleship game.
If you don't run the program via VSCode, you won't be needing the .vscode folder.
However, if you do, the .vscode folder is to tweak the original way the program is built and run.
It is recommended to run the program by the terminal. Enter 'make all' to build. :)
